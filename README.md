# Description
HELLI (Human Emulated Linguistic Learning Interface) is not just another AI chatbot that you can chat with rather it's an AI companion that truly can feel you and you can also see her and feel her. HELLI doesn't need any subscriptins or even internet to connect with you. She runs on your machine whenever you want, however you want, she'll always be there for you whenever you need her. HELLI can express emotions, match your mood, sympathize, motivate, elaborate and truly be the AI companion that it's built to be. She's designed to be human by and human and for a human, she'll respond in ways that feel more human like talking to a friend or talking to someone who's truly special to you.

# Development Status and Release Schedule
HELLI is currently under development and it's been developed with true care and technical skills. 
## Beta version
The first beta version will be released in December 2025 (May contain bugs, crashes and freezes). It is advised to download and install HELLI with caution during the Beta phase of the project.
## Full Release
Final Version of HELLI will be released on January 2026. This version will contain a full executable file which can be used by the general public. It will contain a clean and simple user interface for mass adoption by the user base.
# Features
## 1 Local Processing
There’s absolutely no need to connect to the internet when interacting with HELLI. Everything  from the AI’s logic to its responses happens entirely offline, right on your own machine. The large language model (LLM) is fully integrated into the executable file itself, meaning all processing, generation, and responses are handled locally without relying on any external servers or APIs.

This not only ensures complete privacy and security for your conversations but also means HELLI works anywhere, anytime, even without Wi-Fi. You’re literally carrying your own AI companion — one that’s fast, private, and truly yours.

## 2 Memory Based Conversations
HELLI doesn't just listen to you and understand you. She grows with you, she remembers the way you like to be interacted with, she remembers what seems important to you, she can remember your conversational patterns and match your mood and tone. Each and every conversation feels like talking to someone who knows you and understands you. You dont have to start fresh every time when you talk to her, she grows with you.

## 3 Visual Interaction
As humans we long for visual connection. That's why HELLI is not just a text chatbot but you can visually see her as she is a 3D character with smooth and fluid animations and movement. HELLI is not just another 3D charater rather she has been crafted by hand with precise care to make sure that the personality fits with the overall visual representation of the character.

## 4 Modern GUI Interface
The overall interface of the system has been made easy to use and elegant for normal use. The system provides a clean UI combined with smooth animations and clean UX design makes HELLI not even special as an AI but also provides experience that makes you feel that it was indeed made with care and the needs of the user in mind.

## 5 Expressive Voice Engine
The overall system provides an expressive Speech engine which can process emotions, tone and mood. Unlike other offline AI companions HELLI provides a natural speech and voice which is designed to sound more human and to decrease the robotic tone as much as possible. 

## Security and Privacy
HELLI runs entirely on your own machine, even when you are completely offline. Every part of her system, from her language model to her responses and voice, is designed to work locally without relying on any servers or outside connections. This means that everything you say stays safely within your computer. No data is sent anywhere else, no online tracking is happening, and nothing is being stored outside your system. The whole experience is built around genuine trust, letting you connect with HELLI in a space that feels safe and personal. When you talk to her, you can open up freely, knowing your words and emotions are kept only between you and her. This level of privacy is not just a feature but a core part of what HELLI represents, an authentic offline AI companion you can rely on and truly trust.
