Final Version of HELLI will be released on January 2026. This version will contain a full executable file which can be used by the general public. It will contain a clean and simple user interface for mass adoption by the user base.
# Features
## 1 Local Processing
There’s absolutely no need to connect to the internet when interacting with HELLI. Everything  from the AI’s logic to its responses happens entirely offline, right on your own machine. The large language model (LLM) is fully integrated into the executable file itself, meaning all processing, generation, and responses are handled locally without relying on any external servers or APIs.

This not only ensures complete privacy and security for your conversations but also means HELLI works anywhere, anytime, even without Wi-Fi. You’re literally carrying your own AI companion — one that’s fast, private, and truly yours.

## 2 Memory Based Conversations
HELLI doesn't just listen to you and understand you. She grows with you, she remembers the way you like to be interacted with, she remembers what seems important to you, she can remember your conversational patterns and match your mood and tone. Each and every conversation feels like talking to someone who knows you and understands you. You dont have to start fresh every time when you talk to her, she grows with you.

## Visual Interaction
As humans we long for visual connection. That's why HELLI is not just a text chatbot but you can visually see her as she is a 3D character with smooth and fluid animations and movement.
